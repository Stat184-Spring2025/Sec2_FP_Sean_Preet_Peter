We were trying to identify the relationship between climate change the rise of city temperatures across the United States.

## Repo Structure

In our repo, you will find both the pdf and the qmd files of our final report, under Project.pdf and Project.qmd. Any and all code we developed will be under the projectCode.R file, which we used to run our code before creating out final report. The current file, the README file, is a brief overview of the repo itself. The Project_Guidelines files is the guidelines we followed to complete this project.
